<h1> Traveling in Google Maps </h1>
      <p>
          Inspired in the code of <a href="http://econym.org.uk/gmap/example_cartrip3.htm">car trip</a>, 
          I created this javascript small project. It allows to draw simultaneous vehicles, cars and 
          planes, with travel into google maps with some cool features, like changing 
          sprite while rotate, smarty camera, and easy to understand and extend 
          javascript code.
